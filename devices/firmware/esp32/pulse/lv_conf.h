/**
 * @file lv_conf.h
 * LVGL 9.2.2, configured for the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8 (V2).
 *
 * This is `lvgl/lv_conf_template.h` from the installed library, with the content switch turned on
 * and six deliberate departures from it. Starting from the template rather than writing the file by
 * hand is not laziness: `lv_conf_internal.h` is generated from the same template and warns on any
 * define it cannot find, so a hand-written subset drifts silently across an LVGL upgrade. Every
 * change below is marked `ANCHOR:` so `diff` against the template of whatever version is installed
 * says exactly what this board asked for.
 *
 * ==========================================================================================
 * HOW THIS FILE IS FOUND, which is the part that wastes a day when it is wrong
 * ==========================================================================================
 *
 * It is found by `__has_include`, from the sketch directory, and by nothing else.
 *
 * `lvgl/src/lv_conf_internal.h` opens with:
 *
 *     #ifdef __has_include
 *         #if __has_include("lv_conf.h")
 *             #define LV_CONF_INCLUDE_SIMPLE
 *         #endif
 *     #endif
 *     ... #elif defined(LV_CONF_INCLUDE_SIMPLE)  ->  #include "lv_conf.h"
 *
 * and `arduino-cli` puts the sketch's own directory on the include path of *every* translation unit
 * in the build, the library's included. So this file being named `lv_conf.h` and sitting next to
 * `pulse.ino` is the whole mechanism. Nothing defines `LV_CONF_PATH`, nothing is copied into
 * `~/Arduino/libraries/` next to the `lvgl` folder (the other documented location), and the compile
 * command in the README passes no `--build-property`.
 *
 * **Measured, and the control was made to fail first**, per AGENTS.md. A throwaway sketch with a
 * one-line `lv_conf.h` containing `#error` was compiled with the same FQBN: the build stopped on
 * that `#error`, which it could only do if this path is real. The failure mode this rules out is the
 * quiet one — LVGL falling back to template defaults, giving you 64 kB of internal-SRAM pool and no
 * Montserrat, while the file you are editing is never opened. If you ever suspect it, LVGL prints
 * `#pragma message("Possible failure to include lv_conf.h ...")`; look for that line, and re-run the
 * `#error` probe rather than reasoning about it.
 *
 * The host simulator (`../sim/lvgl.sh`) compiles the same file with `-I <this directory>`, so the
 * screen the desktop renders and the screen the board renders are configured identically. That is
 * the point of it being here rather than in a per-target copy.

     * ANCHOR: 128 KiB rather than the template's 64, and the pool comes out of PSRAM.
     *
     * Internal SRAM is the scarce thing on this part and `app/app.ino` says why in two places: the
     * 8 kB tile buffer is kept internal *because* it is memcpy'd through on every byte, and the
     * 329,728-byte framebuffer is in PSRAM because the part will not hand that much internal RAM out
     * once the USB stack has taken its share. LVGL's object tree, styles, draw descriptors and font
     * glyph cache are none of them on a hot memcpy path, so they belong in the 8 MB that is going
     * spare — measured at 7,943,664 bytes free at boot in `docs/devices-esp32.md`.
     *
     * The template's default would put all of it in an internal static array, which on this board is
     * a quarter of what is left after the USB stack.
     *
     * Explore plus Wi-Fi setup outgrew the former 64 kB pool. The scripted navigation test
     * reproduced a layer-allocation retry loop: 7,432 bytes free, largest block 7,232 bytes,
     * against a required 7,872-byte layer. A 96 kB pool still failed with 32 scan results.
     * Keep 128 kB for the combined screens and their transient
     * draw layers. The simulator uses this same budget, fails on an allocation warning, and tests
     * scan, typing and navigation together. Physical TLS heap and stack headroom are separate
     * measurements; a passing LVGL test does not establish either one.
     *
     * `heap_caps_malloc` is the ESP-IDF allocator. The host simulator compiles this same file
     * against `sim/include/esp_heap_caps.h`, which is a shim over `malloc` with a `--no-psram`
     * switch, so both builds exercise the same pool budget. Platform object sizes can still differ;
     * the desktop figures above are regression evidence, not measurements of board heap usage.

/*
 * ANCHOR: eight widgets on, eighteen off, and the template has them all on.
 *
 * What this screen is made of is a base object, some labels and a rule — so `LV_USE_LABEL`,
 * `LV_USE_IMAGE` (the label widget's documented dependency, and what an artwork background would
 * arrive as), `LV_USE_BUTTON` (the default theme's button style is what a touch target inherits),
 * and `LV_USE_BAR` for the sync meter this page grows next. Wi-Fi setup adds four more —
 * `LV_USE_KEYBOARD`, `LV_USE_BUTTONMATRIX`, `LV_USE_TEXTAREA` and `LV_USE_LIST` — and the note
 * against the first of them prices them. Everything else — a calendar, a chart, a file-manager
 * window — is flash spent on code that cannot be reached from any screen this firmware builds.
 *
 * Turning them off is measurable rather than tidy-minded: LVGL's own docs price the widget set in
 * tens of kilobytes, and the app partition here is 3 MB shared with the ESP32 core, Arduino_GFX and
 * four Montserrat faces. The check that this is not merely cosmetic is the flash figure in the
 * README — flip a few back on and watch it move.
 *
 * The rule when adding one: turn it on *here*, in the same change that uses it, and read the
 * dependency note the template prints beside each line. A widget that is enabled and unused is the
 * same defect as a font that is.

 * ANCHOR: the keyboard, the text field and the list, for `pulse_wifi.cpp`.
 *
 * These four are on together because they are one feature: joining a Wi-Fi network from the glass.
 * `app/wifi_setup.cpp` did it with a hand-drawn key grid against Arduino_GFX and the simulator found
 * seven bugs in it, five of which were consequences of owning the drawing and the hit-testing
 * separately — a JOIN button that fired across a third of the panel where nothing was drawn, an SSID
 * that wrapped over the top row of keys, a list that could not scroll to entries it had collected.
 * `lv_keyboard`, `lv_textarea` and `lv_list` are tested code that already holds hit-testing,
 * scrolling, shift state and password masking, and the flash they cost buys all of that at once.
 *
 * Measured, not estimated, and measured *twice* because the first question was the wrong one.
 *
 * Turning these four on, with `pulse_wifi.cpp` present but not yet called from `pulse.ino`, takes
 * the sketch from 747,540 bytes to 759,984: **12,444 bytes of flash and 104 bytes of static RAM**
 * for the widget code. That is a real number and it is not the cost of the feature — once
 * `pulse.ino` actually calls the module, the ESP32 Wi-Fi station stack comes with it and the sketch
 * reaches 1,274,123. The *honest* figure is the one taken in the configuration this ships in, where
 * `app/feed.cpp` has already linked that stack: with `secrets.h` present, adding Wi-Fi setup costs
 * **28,292 bytes of flash and 1,960 bytes of static RAM** over the same firmware without it
 * (1,472,139 → 1,500,431). Half a megabyte and twenty-eight kilobytes are both true; only one of
 * them is the price of this feature.
 *
 * Flip these four back off and the 12,444 returns, which is the check that they are the thing being
 * priced rather than something that moved alongside them.
